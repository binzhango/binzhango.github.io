??? question "Explain bias-variance tradeoff. How does it manifest in LLMs?"

    - **Bias**: Error from incorrect assumption in the model
        - High bias leads to underfitting, where the model fails to capture patterns in the training data
    - **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data
        - High variance leads to overfitting, where the model memorizes noise instead of learning generalization patterns
